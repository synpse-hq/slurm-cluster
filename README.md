## Slurm

A Slurm scheduler cluster typically consists of the following components:

Slurm controller: The Slurm controller is the central component of the cluster and is responsible for managing the scheduling and execution of jobs. It communicates with the compute nodes to allocate resources and manage job execution.

Compute nodes: The compute nodes are the machines in the cluster that are used to run jobs. They are typically connected to the Slurm controller via a high-speed network.

Slurm database: The Slurm database is used to store information about the jobs and resources in the cluster. It is typically a relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Slurm accounting storage: The Slurm accounting storage is used to store information about job accounting and usage statistics. It is typically a time-series database such as Graphite or InfluxDB.

Slurm plugins: Slurm plugins are used to extend the functionality of the Slurm scheduler. They can be used to implement custom scheduling policies, resource allocation algorithms, and other features.

Each of these components plays a critical role in the operation of a Slurm scheduler cluster. The Slurm controller is responsible for managing the scheduling and execution of jobs, while the compute nodes are responsible for running the jobs themselves. The Slurm database and accounting storage are used to store information about the jobs and resources in the cluster, while the plugins are used to extend the functionality of the scheduler.
